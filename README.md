* Vanilla JS (ES6 / Babel)
* System Fonts & FOUT
* Offline Support w/ Service Worker
* Focus on Speed and Accessibility

## 🏗️ Installation

Eleventy is a static site generator based on Javascript, so you will need node and npm/yarn to run it.

1. `git clone https://github.com/ndom91/home2019`
2. `cd home2019`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run start`

## 🚀 Getting Started

The local development environment uses gulp to process various stuff for the site. 
The most important commands can be run as npm scripts:

`npm start`: make a development build and serve the site through browsersync  
`npm run build`: make a production build  
`npm run serve`: serve the current build `dist` directory  
`npm run debug`: start Eleventy in debug mode and serve the site
